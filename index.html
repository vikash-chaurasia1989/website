                    <p>My primary focus lies in the intricate study of elastic curves and surfaces, emphasizing their relationship with differential geometry. Additionally, I explore the complexities of nonlinear ordinary differential equations within the field of Elasticity.</p>
<p>My recent work revolves around developing finite-difference schemes for shape optimization based on elastic energy. This endeavor entails precise formulation of physical constraints and boundary conditions. To bring these concepts to life, I create mathematical software in languages such as Matlab, Python, or Rust, bridging theory with practical numerical solutions.</p>
<p>I derive immense satisfaction from crafting well-informed initial hypotheses, which, when pursued, lead to the discovery of nontrivial solutions. This expands the horizons of elasticity and shape optimization.</p>
<p>My passion extends to creating photorealistic images and animations of optimized shapes, accomplished through the synergy of Python and Blender. Additionally, I develop web-based interactive visualizations, recognizing the value of effective visualization tools in enhancing the understanding of our results, illuminating the intricate world of elasticity and its applications in shape optimization.</p>

                        <p class="notice--info">
                            I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/mmmu">Mechanics and Materials Unit</a> at <a href="https://www.oist.jp/">Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST)</a>. I received my Bachelors and Masters degrees in <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/me/">Mechanical Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/">IIT Kanpur</a>. During my masters, I worked on developing energy preserving symplectic algorithms for discrete Hamiltonian systems. I got my  Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.me.uh.edu/"> Mechanical Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.uh.edu/">University of Houston</a>. <br /><br />My main research interest is the development of variational frameworks and their application to energy based optimal shapes of curves and surfaces. Unstretchable material, virus modeling, interfacial mechanics.<br /> dd. 
                            
                            A differential geometer by training, I received my PhD from Texas Tech
                            University under the guidance of <a href="http://www.math.ttu.edu/~mtoda/">Magdalena
                                Toda</a>, with co-advisors <a href="http://www.math.ttu.edu/~eaulisa/">Eugenio
                                Aulisa</a> and <a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~hungtt1/">Hung Tran</a>. At this time,
                            I applied techniques from Riemannian geometry, variational calculus, and differential
                            topology to study functionals involving surface curvature, with the ultimate goal of
                            understanding their extrema. Moreover, I was (and still am) interested in understanding the
                            possible immersions of a given topological space inside another, including what
                            configurations are “preferred” (usually energy-minimizing) in this case. I also spent quite
                            a bit of time thinking about the computational modeling of geometric objects, sparking a
                            standing interest in computer graphics which can be seen in the various simulation videos
                            found on the <a href="gallery/index.html">Gallery</a> page. <br /><br /> Catalyzed by an NSF
                            internship at Oak Ridge National Lab (featured <a
                                href="https://orise.orau.gov/nsf-msgi/profiles/gruber.html">here!</a>) toward the end of
                            graduate school where I worked with <a
                                href="https://sites.google.com/site/robertbridgeshomepage/">Robert Bridges</a>, I became
                            involved post-PhD in scientific algorithm development for dimension reduction, function
                            approximation, and the reduced-order modeling of PDEs. This led to a postdoctoral
                            appointment with <a href="https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~mgunzburger/">Max Gunzburger</a> at FSU
                            working on data-driven strategies for predictive tasks related to ocean modeling. At the
                            same time as my application-driven interests were shifting, my purer “side project” work
                            also moved in the direction of rigidity results for geometric objects constrained by
                            curvature conditions. Now, I maintain active interests in several areas of mathematics,
                            computer science, and engineering. <br /><br /> Broad research keywords which tend to
                            interest me include: scientific machine learning, computational and discrete geometry,
                            conservation laws, reduced-order modeling, manifold learning, harmonic maps, surface
                            immersions, and integrability problems. A more detailed description of my interests can be
                            found in my <a href="files/Research_Statement.pdf">academic research statement</a> (current

                        <!-- Lately, my focus is primarily on developing structure-informed numerical methods for scientific applications. Doing this generally involves identifying/reasoning about some abstract mathematical structure which is important for a particular phenomenon, formulating a smart discretization (based on e.g. a finite element or artificial neural network backbone) which takes this structure into account, and writing mathematical software in Python or C++ which implements the proposed discretization. Over time, I've found that my preferred "flavor" of research problem creates ample opportunity for algebraic reasoning, flashy visuals, and short "punchy" arguments which are characteristic of my personal style. <br><br> -->

                        large-scale simulation frequently operate at a data deficit which creates problems inverse to
                        the issues with “big data”. Particularly, there is a need for efficient function approximation
                        and model reduction strategies which can serve as cheap and reliable surrogates for the
                        high-fidelity models used in practical applications. These projects develop such technology
                        using invariances and other structural considerations as a starting point, allowing for informed
                        surrogates with beneficial behavior.</p>

                            The role of these physics is unclear, however, with successful examples of both reversible
                            (e.g., Hamiltonian) and irreversible (e.g., diffusion) phenomena producing comparable
                            results despite diametrically opposed mechanisms, and further complications arising due to
                            empirical departures from mathematical theory. This work presents a series of novel GNN
                            architectures based upon structure-preserving bracket-based dynamical systems, which are
                            provably guaranteed to either conserve energy or generate positive dissipation with
                            increasing depth. It is shown that the theoretically principled framework employed here
                            allows for inherently explainable constructions, which contextualize departures from theory
                            in current architectures and better elucidate the roles of reversibility and irreversibility

                            presented. Based on the idea of operator inference, this technique is provably convergent

                            depends on the solution of a complex system (e.g., of partial differential equations with
                            random inputs) are often, if not nearly ubiquitously, determined in practice using Monte
                            Carlo (MC) estimation. While simple to implement, MC estimation fails to provide reliable
                            information about statistical quantities (such as the expected value of the output of
                            interest) in application settings such as climate modeling for which obtaining a single
                            realization of the output of interest is a costly endeavor. Specifically, the dilemma
                            encountered is that many samples of the output of interest have to be collected in order to
                            obtain an MC estimator having sufficient accuracy; so many, in fact, that the available
                            computational budget is not large enough to effect the number of samples needed. To
                            circumvent this dilemma, we consider using multifidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) estimation which
                            leverages the use of less costly and less accurate surrogate models (such as coarser grids,
                            reduced-order models, simplified physics, interpolants, etc.) to achieve, for the same
                            computational budget, higher accuracy compared to that obtained by an MC estimator or,
                            looking at it another way, an MFMC estimator obtains the same accuracy as the MC estimator
                            at lower computational cost. The key to the efficacy of MFMC estimation is the fact that
                            most of the required computational budget is loaded onto the less costly surrogate models,
                            so that very few samples are taken of the more expensive model of interest. We first provide
                            a more detailed discussion about the need to consider an alternate to MC estimation for
                            uncertainty quantification. Subsequently, we present a review, in an abstract setting, of
                            the MFMC approach along with its application to three climate-related benchmark problems as
                            a proof-of-concept exercise. <br /><br /> (Joint with <a

                            describing complete dynamical systems which conserve energy and produce entropy. This
                            creates challenges for model reduction, as the elimination of high-frequency information
                            will generally not preserve the metriplectic structure which governs long-term stability of
                            the system. Based on proper orthogonal decomposition, a provably convergent metriplectic
                            reduced-order model is formulated which is guaranteed to maintain the algebraic structure
                            necessary for energy conservation and entropy formation. Numerical results on benchmark

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> The popularity of deep convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) has
                            engendered new and effective reduced-order models (ROMs) for the simulation of large-scale
                            dynamical systems. Despite this, it is still unknown whether deep CAEs provide superior
                            performance over established linear techniques or other network-based methods in all
                            modeling scenarios. To elucidate this, the effect of autoencoder architecture on its
                            associated ROM is studied through the comparison of deep CAEs against two alternatives: a
                            simple fully connected autoencoder, and a novel graph convolutional autoencoder. Through
                            benchmark experiments, it is shown that the superior autoencoder architecture for a given
                            ROM application is highly dependent on the size of the latent space and the structure of the

                            ``Nonlinear Level set Learning’’ (NLL) approach is presented for the pointwise prediction of
                            functions which have been sparsely sampled. Leveraging geometric information provided by the
                            Implicit Function Theorem, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the input dimension to
                            the theoretical lower bound with minor accuracy loss, providing a one-dimensional
                            representation of the function which can be used for regression and sensitivity analysis.
                            Experiments and applications are presented which compare this modified NLL with the original
                            NLL and the Active Subspaces (AS) method. While accommodating sparse input data, the
                            proposed algorithm is shown to train quickly and provide a much more accurate and
                            informative reduction than either AS or the original NLL on two example functions with
                            high-dimensional domains, as well as two state-dependent quantities depending on the

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Due to the curse of dimensionality and limitations on training
                            data, approximating high-dimensional functions is a very challenging task even for powerful
                            deep neural networks. Inspired by the Nonlinear Level set Learning (NLL) method that uses
                            the reversible residual network (RevNet), in this paper we propose a new method for function
                            approximation called Dimension Reduction via Learning Level Sets (DRiLLS). Our method
                            contains two major components: one is the pseudo-reversible neural network (PRNN) module
                            that effectively transforms high-dimensional input variables to low-dimensional active
                            variables, and the other is the synthesized regression module for approximating function
                            values based on the transformed data in the low-dimensional space. Extensive experimental
                            results demonstrate that DRiLLS outperforms both the NLL and Active Subspace methods,
                            especially when the target function possesses critical points in the interior of its input
                            domain. <br /><br /> (Joint with <a href="https://people.math.sc.edu/ju/">Lili Ju</a>, <a

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> We present an approach to analyze \(C^1(\mathbb{R}^m)\) functions
                            that addresses limitations present in the Active Subspaces (AS) method of Constantine et al.
                            Under appropriate hypotheses, our Active Manifolds (AM) method identifies a 1-D curve in the
                            domain (the active manifold) on which nearly all values of the unknown function are
                            attained, and which can be exploited for approximation or analysis, especially when \(m\) is
                            large (high-dimensional input space). We provide theorems justifying our AM technique and an
                            algorithm permitting functional approximation and sensitivity analysis. Using accessible,
                            low-dimensional functions as initial examples, we show AM reduces approximation error by an
                            order of magnitude compared to AS, at the expense of more computation. Following this, we
                            revisit the sensitivity analysis by Glaws et al. who apply AS to analyze a
                            magnetohydrodynamic power generator model, and compare the performance of AM on the same
                            data. Our analysis provides detailed information not captured by AS, exhibiting the
                            influence of each parameter individually along an active manifold. Overall, AM represents a
                            novel technique for analyzing functional models with benefits including: reducing
                            \(m\)-dimensional analysis to a 1-D analogue, permitting more accurate regression than AS
                            (at more computational expense), enabling more informative sensitivity analysis, and
                            granting accessible visualizations (2-D plots) of parameter sensitivity along the AM.

                        mappings between Riemannan spaces. When these mappings are constrained by natural geometric
                        conditions on e.g. curvature, their existence is governed by overdetermined PDEs which are
                        difficult to approach using classical analytic techniques. These projects establish

                            product of irreducible factors determined by the spectrum of that tensor. This decomposition
                            is global when \(M\) is simply connected, and generalizes what is known for immersed
                            submanifolds with parallel mean curvature vector.</p>

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Quasiconformal mappings from surfaces immersed in Euclidean space
                            are discussed for the purposes of computing dilatation-optimal surface meshes with
                            prescribed connectivity and Dirichlet boundary data. In particular, a quaternionic
                            formulation of quasiconformality is proposed which leads to a linear algorithm for computing
                            least-squares quasiconformal maps from surfaces given as extrinsic mesh data. This
                            facilitates an iterative procedure which computes optimal quasiconformal mappings with
                            optional constraints on surface area and extrinsic geometry. Based on the established
                            Quasiconformal Iteration method, the proposed algorithm produces high quality surface
                            mappings which correctly capture boundary information while eliminating undesirable folds

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> The unsigned p-Willmore functional generalizes important
                            geometric functionals which measure the area and Willmore energy of immersed surfaces.
                            Presently, techniques of Dziuk are adapted to compute the first variation of this functional
                            as a weak-form system of equations, which are subsequently used to develop a model for the
                            p-Willmore flow of closed surfaces in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). This model is amenable to
                            constraints on surface area and enclosed volume, and is shown to decrease the p-Willmore
                            energy monotonically. In addition, a penalty-based regularization procedure is formulated to
                            prevent artificial mesh degeneration along the flow; inspired by a conformality condition
                            derived by Kamberov et al., this procedure encourages angle-preservation in a closed and
                            oriented surface immersion as it evolves. Following this, a finite-element discretization of
                            both procedures is discussed, an algorithm for running the flow is given, and an application
                            to mesh editing is presented. <br /><br /> (Joint with <a

                            of biomembranes. It is shown that the potential minimizers of this energy are highly
                            dependent on the choice of physical rigidity parameters, and that the area of critical
                            surfaces can be computed entirely from their boundary data. When the elastic modulus does

                            Precisely, a generalized “bending energy” functional \(\mathcal{W}\) is considered which
                            involves a Lagrangian that is symmetric in the principal curvatures. The first variation of
                            \(\mathcal{W}\) is computed, and a stress tensor is extracted whose divergence quantifies
                            deviation from \(\mathcal{W}\)-criticality. Boundary-value problems are then examined, and a
                            characterization of free-boundary \(\mathcal{W}\)-surfaces with rotational symmetry is given
                            for scaling-invariant \(\mathcal{W}\)-functionals. In case the functional is not
                            scaling-invariant, certain boundary-to-interior consequences are discussed. Finally, some
                            applications to the conformal Willmore energy and the p-Willmore energy of surfaces are
                            presented. <br /><br /> (Joint with <a href="http://www.math.ttu.edu/~mtoda/">Magdalena

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Functionals involving surface curvature are important across a
                            range of scientific disciplines, and their extrema are representative of physically
                            meaningful objects such as atomic lattices and biomembranes. Inspired in particular by the
                            relationship of the Willmore energy to lipid bilayers, we consider a general functional
                            depending on a surface and a symmetric combination of its principal curvatures, provided the
                            surface is immersed in a 3-D space form. We compute the first and second variations of this
                            functional, leading to expressions given entirely in terms of the surface fundamental forms.
                            We then apply the stability criteria afforded by our calculations to a generalization of the
                            Willmore functional, proving a result regarding the stability of spheres. <br /><br />

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Functionals involving surface curvature are frequently
                            encountered when modeling the behavior of important biological structures such as lipid
                            membranes. To better understand these objects, we consider a general functional on surface
                            immersions which is dependent on the surface mean and Gauss curvatures. Variations of this
                            functional are presented, and stability criteria are given in terms of basic geometric
                            invariants coming from the surface fundamental forms. These results are then applied to a
                            particular curvature functional which generalizes the Willmore energy, and a nonexistence
                            result is presented. A constrained minimization problem is then considered, leading to a
                            stability result involving round spheres. Further study is done on a generalization of the
                            Willmore flow of surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ – a geometric tool known for its aesthetic
                            beauty. In particular, two finite-element formulations of this problem are presented: one
                            which is applicable to surfaces presented graphically, and the other which models closed
                            immersed (possibly self-intersecting) surfaces and is amenable to constraints on surface
                            area and enclosed volume. It is shown in both cases that the energy decreases along the
                            flow. Moreover, stability and consistency results are obtained in the closed surface model,
                            and examples of the implementation are discussed. Inspired by conformal geometry, a
                            post-processing procedure is also presented, which ensures that a given surface mesh remains
                            nearly conformal along the Willmore flow despite its initial regularity. This abolishes the
                            mesh degeneration that usually accompanies position-based surface flows, and leads to a
                            robust model that can accommodate variable time steps as well as surface genera.</p>
